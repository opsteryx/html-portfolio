<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I am an engineer by heart. I love to understand how aomething functions and I am always curious about its workings and design.<br/>Those who know me also know that I am a musician, who plays the drums, tabla and a tiny bit of guitar.<br/>Video games call to my heart and always provide a good time whenever I need me a pick-me-up.
